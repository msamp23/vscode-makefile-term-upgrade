# vscode-makefile-term 

This extension allows you to run a `Makefile` `target` from within the
editor by clicking above the `target`. It will execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd ${makefileDir} && make -f ${filename} ${target}
```

* `makefileDir` - the directory of the Makefile that is being edited
* `filename` - file where you clicked the TARGET
* `target`  - the text found using the following logic: 
  *  any line starting with an alphabeticnumeric string followed by a colon and not including `=`
